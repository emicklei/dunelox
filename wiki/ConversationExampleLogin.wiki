#summary How to implement the Login UseCase

= Introduction =

Suppose we are building an application that requires users to authenticate using the standard login/password request. Typically, you have some kind of a UseCase specification that describes the steps and explains the happy flow. Clearly, there will be an interaction sequence (conversation) between the user, the application and some authentication service.

= Details =

  # The main application (View) will start the conversation *Login* and tell the conversation *Login* to report to the main application when login was succesfull.
  # The conversation will inspect the Context whether credentials (username, password) are available. 
  # If not, the conversation *Login* will show an input dialog requesting the user to provide this information. 
  # After accepting the input to this dialog, the conversation *Login* will send the login command request using an application server (through a !ServiceProxy). The Client will send the request and receive the response and report to the usecase *Login* with the answer (Reply). 
  # The conversation *Login* will store the information (user,logged_in) into the Context and report to the application (View) that the conversation Login is completed. Reporting is done by invoking the handler that was passed when the conversation was started.

= Source Code =

	public class Login extends Conversation
	{
		private var _login:String

			// ... handle user login request by invoking a remote service...
			this.end()

                        return _login;

To start the Login conversation in the Application component.
{{{
new Login().start(this, handleLoginOk)

private function handleLoginOk(cvs:Login):void {
     current_user = cvs.getLogin()
