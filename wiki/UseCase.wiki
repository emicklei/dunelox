#summary Mediator that implements the flow of application and user interactions

= Introduction =
As part of Requirements Gathering, usecases describe the interaction between an actor and the system to be build. A user initiates (start) a usecase through events from some UI control. In response to that, the system may request information from the user in order to complete (end) the usecase. The usecase is in control of that flow.

Building an application requires implementing all usecases. View components are needed to execute usescases and will present the user with result information. In case of RIA, typically information is needed that is provided using application services.

Class UseCase can be used to implement the mediation process in which user interaction, information retrieval and information presentation is coordinated. Class UseCase provides an implementation of a coding pattern to facilitate this.
