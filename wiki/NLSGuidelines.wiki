#guidelines in choosing NLS keys and applying NLS in general

= Introduction =

[Internationalization] explains how NLS works.
Here we describe good practices when using NLS in your application.

= Choosing Keys =
NLS messages are stored in a resource file with the following structure:
{{{
key=message
}}}
Both the *key* and *message* are text entries.
Following any convention in choosing these keys and messages will help you maintain these resources. Using the "dotted prefix" notation is a practice to organize the keys. Examples are:
{{{
label.student=Student:
label.course=Course:
title.form.student=Edit Student
title.form.subject=Edit Subject
msg.student.notfound=No such Student registered
msg.exam.timeexpired=Time to finish this exam has expired
}}}
